# Deep_Learning_Unit_14

This repository will demonstrate how deep learning recurrent neural networks models, can utilize indicators such as the Crypto Fear and Greed Index (FNG) values and historic closing prices to evaluate which method outputs a superior signal.

The following was completed:

prepare-the-data-for-training-and-testing
build-and-train-custom-lstm-rnns
evaluate-the-performance-of-each-model
